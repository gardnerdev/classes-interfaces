# classes-interfaces


As an object-oriented programming language, Python supports a full range of features, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Getting things done in Python often requires writing new classes and defining how they interact through their interfaces and hierarchies.

Python's classes and inheritance make it easy to express a program's intended behaviors with objects. They allow you to improve and expand functionality over time. They provide flexibility in an environment of changing requirements. Knowing how to use them well enables you to write maintainable code


I want to record the grades of a set of students whose names aren't known in advance. I can define a class to store the names in a dictionary instead of using a predefined attribute for each student.

Python's built-in dictionary type is wonderful for maintaining dynamic internal state over the lifetime of an object. By dynamic, I mean situations in which you need to do bookkeeping for an unexpected set of identifiers.
